* Open the workspace or folder containing your Ceedling project
* Configure your `project.yml` path in the VS Code's settings if required [see below](#options)
* Configure the shell path where ceedling is installed in the VS Code's settings if required (It might be required on Windows) [see below](#options)
* Enable the `xml_tests_report` Ceedling plugin in your `project.yml` [see the ceedling doc](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Ceedling/blob/master/docs/CeedlingPacket.md#tool-element-runtime-substitution-notational-substitution)
* Open the Test view
* Run your tests using the ![Run](img/run.png) icons in the Test Explorer or the CodeLenses in your test file

## Configuration

### Options

Property                                | Description
----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
`ceedlingExplorer.projectPath`          | The path to the ceedling project (where the `project.yml` is) to use (relative to the workspace folder). By default (or if this option is set to `null`) it use the same path as the workspace folder.
`ceedlingExplorer.shellPath`            | The path to the shell where ceedling is installed. By default (or if this option is set to `null`) it use the OS default shell.
`ceedlingExplorer.debugConfiguration`   | The Debug configuration to run during debugging. See Debugging for more info.  

## Commands

The following commands are available in VS Code's command palette, use the ID to add them to your keyboard shortcuts:

ID                                 | Command
-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------
`test-explorer.reload`             | Reload tests
`test-explorer.run-all`            | Run all tests
`test-explorer.run-file`           | Run tests in current file
`test-explorer.run-test-at-cursor` | Run the test at the current cursor position
`test-explorer.cancel`             | Cancel running tests

## Debugging

To set up debugging, create a new Debug Configuration. `${command:ceedlingExplorer.debugTestExecutable}` 
can be used access the .out test executable filename (without directory) being ran. Depending on your Ceedling configuration
these can be found in `projectPath/build/test/out/`. Then, edit the `ceedlingExplorer.debugConfiguration` settings with the name of the Debug Configuration to run during debug.

Note: Individual test debugging is not supported. Instead the entire test file will be ran, so skip or remove breakpoints accordingly.

Example configuration with `ms-vscode.cpptools`:
```json
{
    "name": "Ceedling Test Explorer Debug",
    "type": "cppdbg",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/test/out/${command:ceedlingExplorer.debugTestExecutable}",
    "args": [],
    "stopAtEntry": false,
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "environment": [],
    "externalConsole": false,
    "MIMode": "gdb",
    "miDebuggerPath": "C:/MinGW/bin/gdb.exe",
    "setupCommands": [
        {
            "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
            "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
            "ignoreFailures": true
        }
    ]
}
```
